1. swap - swap the first element with the second element of a stack
	// sa, sb, ss (swap of two stacks)

sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.


2. push - take an element from one stack and put it at the top of another stack
	// pa, pb,
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
Do nothing if b is empty.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
Do nothing if a is empty.

3. rotate - move/shift up all elements of the stack by 1
	// ra, rb, rr (both)

ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.

4. reverse rotate - move/shift all elements one down
	// rra, rrb, rrr

rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.*/
